## Definition

- The neural networkâ€™s ability to decide what values are more important than others

## Characteristics

- Calculating attention allows the neural network to decide what values it will pay attention to at each stage of generating the output sentence
- By taking the attention score, multiplying them by the hidden state values generated by the network, and adding them up, the neural network will create a final context vector that the decoder can use to calculate the final word

## Challenges

- Sequential training of word after word in calculations in [[Recurrent Neural Networks|RNN]] can be time-consuming
- With the growth of large language models, they take longer and longer to train
- A desire for parallelism has steadily grown as larger and larger datasets need to be trained
