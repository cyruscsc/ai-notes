## Definition

- Represents text as an unordered collection of words
- Ignores syntax and considers only the meanings of the words in the sentence

## Characteristics

- Helpful in some [[classification]] tasks
	- E.g. sentiment analysis, spam email filtering
- E.g. based only on the words in each sentence and ignoring the grammar:
	> 1. "My grandson loved it! So much fun!"
	> 2. "Product broke after a few days."
	> 3. "One of the best games Iâ€™ve played in a long time."
	> 4. "Kind of cheap and flimsy, not worth it."
	- Sentences 1 and 3 are positive ("loved", "fun", "best")
	- Sentences 2 and 4 are negative ("broke", "cheap", "flimsy")
- Can be used in [[sentiment analysis]]
