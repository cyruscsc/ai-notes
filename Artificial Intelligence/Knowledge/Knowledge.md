## Concepts

### Knowledge-based agents

- Agents that reason by operating on internal representations of knowledge

### Sentence

- An assertion about the world in a knowledge representation language

### Syntax 

- The "grammatical rules" of sentences

### Semantics

- The "meaning" of sentences

### Tautology

- A sentence that always holds true
- E.g. $P\lor\neg P$ (the law of the excluded middle)

## Knowledge and search problem

- Initial state: starting [[Knowledge|knowledge]] base
- Actions: [[Inference Rules|inference rules]]
- Transition model: new [[Knowledge|knowledge]] base after [[Inference|inference]]
- Goal test: checking whether the statement that we are trying to prove is in the KB
- Path cost: the number of steps in the proof
