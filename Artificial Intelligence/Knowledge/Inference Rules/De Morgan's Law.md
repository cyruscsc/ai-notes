- Turns an And connective into an Or connective
- For the And proposition earlier to be true, at least one of the propositions in the Or propositions must be true
- E.g. "It is not true that both Harry and Ron passed the test" = "It is not true that Harry passed the test" Or "It is not true that Ron passed the test"

- Turns an Or connective into an And connective
- For the And proposition earlier to be true, both propositions in the And propositions must be true
- E.g. "It is not true that Harry or Ron passed the test" = "Harry did not pass the test" And "Ron did not pass the test"
