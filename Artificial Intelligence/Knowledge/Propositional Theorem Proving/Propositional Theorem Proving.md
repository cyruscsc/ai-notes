## Proof methods

- Natural deduction
	- A system for proving theorems using a set of rules that allow the derivation of conclusions from premises
	- E.g. [[Inference Rules]]
- Sequent calculus
	- Uses sequents (a set of formulas on the left and a set on the right) to represent the relationship between premises and conclusions
- [[Model Checking]]

## Concepts

- [[Satisfiability]]
- [[Logical Equivalence]]
- [[Validity]]
- [[Deduction Theorem]]
