## Definition

$$
(P\equiv Q)\leftrightarrow (P\models Q \land Q\models P)
$$

## Characteristics

- Occurs when two formulas have the same truth value for every possible assignment of truth values to their variables
- $P$ and $Q$ are logically equivalent if they are true in the same set of models
- The two formulas express the same proposition, even if they are syntactically different
- Often used to simplify or transform formulas into more manageable forms
