## Definition

$$
P(a\land b)=P(a)P(b)
$$

- Events $a$ and $b$ are independent if and only if the probability of $a$ and $b$ is equal to the probability of $a$ times the probability of $b$
- The knowledge that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event
	- E.g. rolling a 4 with the first die does not influence the value of the second die that we roll
- Opposite to dependent events
	- E.g. clouds in the morning and rain in the afternoon
