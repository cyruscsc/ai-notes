## Definition

- A problem is at least as hard as the hardest problems in [[Nondeterministic Polynomial Time|NP]]
- Every problem in NP can be reduced to the it in polynomial time

## Characteristics

- An NP-hard problem itself is not necessarily belong to NP
- There must exist a polynomial-time reduction from any problem in NP to it, meaning that solving it efficiently would allow all problems in NP to be solved efficiently as well
- Includes decision problems, search problems, and optimization problems
- Also includes problems that are undecidable, meaning no algorithm can solve them for all inputs
