## Definition

- A problem that is both [[Nondeterministic Polynomial Time|NP]] and [[NP-Hard]]

## Characteristics

- Considered the hardest problems in NP
- If any NP-complete problem has a polynomial-time solution, then all NP problems can also be solved in polynomial time

## Examples

- [[Boolean Satisfiability Problem]]
- Knapsack problem
- Travelling salesman problem (decision version)
- Hamiltonian path problem
- Graph colouring problem
