## Local maximum

- A state that has a higher value than its neighboring states

## Global maximum

- A state that has the highest value of all states in the state-space

## Local minimum

- A state that has a lower value than its neighboring states

## Global minimum

- A state that has the lowest value of all states in the state-space

## Flat local maximum/minimum

- Where multiple states of equal value are adjacent, forming a plateau whose neighbors have a worse value

## Shoulder

- Where multiple states of equal value are adjacent and the neighbors of the plateau can be both better and worse
