## Completeness

- Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one?

## Time complexity

- Big O notation

## Space complexity

- Memory requirements

## Optimality

- Does the algorithm find the optimal solution (with regard to path costs)?

## State space / tree complexity

- Branching factor `b`, max number of successors of any node
- Depth `d` of the shallowest goal node
	- The number of steps along the path from the root
- Maximum length `m` of any path in the state space
