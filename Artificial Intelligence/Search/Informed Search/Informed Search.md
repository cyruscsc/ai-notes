## Types of searches

- [[Greedy Best-First Search]]
- [[A* Search]]

## Concepts

- [[Heuristic]]
- [[Contour]]

## Characteristics

- Uses problem-specific knowledge to find solutions more efficiently
- Some knowledge about the problem is available
	- Distance of current node from target
	- Cost of traversing nodes
	- How to reach target
- Considers additional knowledge to try to improve its performance
- Efficiency of the algorithm depends on how good the [[Heuristic|heuristic]] function is
