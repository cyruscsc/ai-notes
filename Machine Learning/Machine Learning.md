## Definition

- Provides a computer with data, rather than explicit instructions
- Using these data, the computer learns to recognize patterns and becomes able to execute tasks on its own

## Terminology

**Training set** = data used to train the model

**Convex function** = a bowl shape function has no local minima other than the single global minimum (e.g. linear regression model)

## Notation

$x$ = input variable / **feature**

$y$ = output variable / **target**

$\hat{y}$ = estimated $y$ / **prediction** of $y$

$(x,y)$ = single training example

$(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$ = $i^{th}$ training example

$m$ = number of training examples

$f$ = **model**
