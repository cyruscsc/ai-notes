## Definition

- Desired level of performance

## Establishing baseline level of performance

- Human level performance
- Competing algorithms performance
- Guess base on experience

## Examining bias and variance

- Gap (baseline performance $\leftrightarrow$  $J_{train}$) = bias
	- Big gap = high bias
	- Small gap = low bias
- Gap (baseline performance $\leftrightarrow$  $J_{cv}$) = variance
	- Big gap = high variance
	- Small gap = low variance
