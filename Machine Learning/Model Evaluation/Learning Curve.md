## Training curve

- $J_{train}(\vec{w},b)$
- Starts with low error
- Error increases and curve flattens out as training set size gets bigger

## Validation curve

- $J_{cv}(\vec{w},b)$
- Starts with high error
- Error decreases and curve flattens out as training set size gets bigger

## High bias learning curves

- Training curve tends to be higher than baseline performance
- Big gap between training curve and baseline performance

## High variance learning curves

- Training curves can be higher or lower than baseline performance
- Big gap between validation curve and training curve
