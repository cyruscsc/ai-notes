## Definition

- Builds a generalized model during training to make predictions on unseen data

## Approach

- Learns parameters or rules from the training data
- Uses optimization techniques to minimize prediction errors
- Once trained, the model is used for fast predictions

## Advantages

- Efficient for large datasets after training
- Generalizes well to unseen data and often provides interpretability

## Disadvantages

- Requires careful [[feature engineering]] and tuning to avoid overfitting [[Generalization#Overfitting|overfitting]]
- May struggle with highly complex relationships if the model is not appropriate

## Examples

- [[Linear Regression]]
- [[Logistic Regression]]
- [[Decision Tree]]
- [[Naive Bayes]]
- [[Neural Networks]]
