## Definition

- A task where the function maps an input to a discrete output
- Predict a category from from small number of possible outputs

## Algorithms

- [[Logistic Regression]]
- [[k-Nearest-Neighbours Classification]]
- [[Perception Learning]]
- [[Support Vector Machines]]
- [[Naive Bayes]]

## Techniques

- [[Laplace Smoothing]]

## Choices of functions

- Linear function
	- Outputs either 0 or 1
	- Employs a **hard threshold**
- Logistic function
	- Yields a real number between 0 and 1
	- Employs a **soft threshold**
