## Characteristics

- Looks at the data as a whole and tries to create a decision boundary
- Every additional data point will be classified based on the side of the line on which it is plotted

## Limitations

- It is rare that one can draw a line and neatly divide the classes into two observations without any mistakes
- drawing a boundary that separates the observations correctly more often than not, but still occasionally misclassifies them
