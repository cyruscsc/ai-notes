## Motivation

- Downside of single [[decision tree]]
	- Highly sensitive to small changes in data
	- Changes on training examples can cause the algorithm to come up with different splits and therefore a totally different tree
- Collection of multiple [[decision tree]]
	- Each tree is a plausible way of [[classification]]
	- Run all trees and get them to vote on final prediction

## Variations

- [[Bagged Decision Tree]]
- [[Random Forest]]
- [[XGBoost]]
