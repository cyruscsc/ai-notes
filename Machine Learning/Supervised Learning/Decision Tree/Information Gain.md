## Definition

$$
IG=H(p_1^\text{root})-(w^\text{left}H(p_1^\text{left})+w^\text{right}H(p_1^\text{right}))
$$
> $H$: entropy
> $p_1$: fraction of true examples
> $w$: fraction of examples in sub-branch

- Reduction in weighted average entropy
- Can be used to measure the quality of a split
- Can be applied to both categorical features and continuous valued features
