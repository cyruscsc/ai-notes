## Algorithms

- [[Markov Decision Process]]
- [[State-Action Value Function|Q function]]
- [[Deep Q-Network]]

## Topics

- [[Exploitation vs Exploration]]

## Characteristics

- After each action, the agent gets feedback in the form of reward or punishment
- Can be viewed as a [[Markov decision process]]

## Approach

- Starts by the environment providing a state to the agent
- Then, the agent performs an action on the state
- Based on this action, the environment will return a state and a reward to the agent
	- Positive reward: making the behavior more likely in the future
	- Negative reward: making the behavior less likely in the future
