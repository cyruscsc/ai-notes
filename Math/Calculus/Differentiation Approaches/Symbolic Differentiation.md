## Definition

- Manipulates mathematical expressions to derive the exact [[derivative]] of a function

## Characteristics

- Works directly on the symbolic representation of a function
- Applies [[differentiation rules]] to create a new expression representing the derivative
- Produces exact results, making it useful for mathematical analysis
- Implemented in computer algebra systems for analytical derivation of derivatives
