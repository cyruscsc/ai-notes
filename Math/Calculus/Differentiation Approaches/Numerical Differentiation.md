## Definition

- Estimates the [[derivative]] of a function using numerical approximations

## Characteristics

- Uses finite difference methods to approximate the derivative
- Relies on function values at specific points rather than the function's symbolic form
- Useful when the function is only known at discrete points or is too complex for symbolic differentiation
- Can introduce round-off errors and is generally less accurate than symbolic methods
