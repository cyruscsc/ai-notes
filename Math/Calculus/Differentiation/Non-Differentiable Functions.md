## Definition

- Do not have a well-defined derivative at certain points

## Types

### Discontinuity

- Functions with jumps or gaps are not differentiable at the point of discontinuity
- E.g., $f(x)=|x|$

### Cusps or corners

- Functions with sharp turns are not differentiable at the point of cusp or corner
- E.g., $f(x)=\begin{cases}2&x<-1\\x+1&x\le-1\end{cases}$

### Vertical tangents

- Functions are not differentiable at the points where the slope of the tangent becomes infinite
- E.g., $f(x)=x^{\frac{1}{3}}$ at $x=0$

### Unbounded functions

- Functions are not differentiable at the points that approach infinity
- E.g., $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ at $x=0$

### Oscillating behavior

- Functions are not differentiable at the points where they oscillate rapidly
- E.g., $f(x)=\sin(\frac{1}{x})$ near $x=0$
