## Definition

$$
\nabla f=\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1},\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2},\dots,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\right]
$$

> For a scalar function $f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$

## Characteristics

- A vector that represents both the direction and the rate of the steepest increase of a scalar function
- The points where $\nabla f=0$ are often [[critical point]]
