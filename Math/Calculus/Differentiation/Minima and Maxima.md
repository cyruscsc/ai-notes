## Definition

- **Local maximum**: a point $x=c$ where $f(c)>f(x)$ for all $x$ in a small interval around $c$
- **Local minimum**: a point $x=c$ where $f(c)<f(x)$ for all $x$ in a small interval around $c$
- **Global maximum**: the highest point of the function over its entire domain
- **Global minimum**: the lowest point of the function over its entire domain

> $c$: [[Critical Point]]

## Finding process

### Find the derivative

- Calculate the first [[Derivative]] $f'(x)$ of the function $f(x)$

### Find critical points

- Set the first derivative $f'(x)=0$ and solve for $x$
- The $x$ values are [[Critical Point|critical points]]

### First derivative test

- Choose test values on either side of each critical point
- Evaluate the sign of $f'(x)$ at those test values
	- If $f'(x)$ changes from positive to negative at a critical point, it is a local maximum
	- If $f'(x)$ changes from negative to positive at a critical point, it is a local minimum
	- If $f'(x)$ does not change change, it might be a inflection point

### Second derivative test

- Calculate the second derivative $f''(x)$
- Evaluate $f''(x)$ at each critical point
	- If $f''(x)<0$, it is a local maximum
	- If $f''(x)>0$, it is a local minimum
	- If $f''(x)=0$, the test is inconclusive; use first derivative test or analyze the function's behavior near the critical point

### Global Extrema

- Evaluate the function at critical points and endpoints (if applicable)
- Compare values to determine global maxima or minima
