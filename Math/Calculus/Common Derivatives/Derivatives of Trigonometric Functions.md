## Definition

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x)&=\cos x\\
\frac{d}{dx}(\cos x)&=-\sin x\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Intuition

### Graphical interpretation

- When $\sin(x)=1$ or $\sin(x)=-1$, its rate of change is 0 and $\cos(x)=0$
- When $\sin(x)=0$, its rate of change is 1 or -1 and $\cos(x)=1$ or $\cos(x)=-1$

### Circular motion

- Imagine a point moving around a unit circle, where the x-coordinate representing $\cos(x)$ and the y-coordinate representing $\sin(x)$
- The rate of change of the y-coordinate is equal to the x-coordinate
- The rate of change of the x-coordinate is the negative of the y-coordinate
