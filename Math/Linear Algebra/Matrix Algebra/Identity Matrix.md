## Definition

$$
I=
\begin{bmatrix}
1&0&\cdots&0\\
0&1&\cdots&0\\
\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
0&0&\cdots&1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- A square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere

## Characteristics

- **Square Matrix**: An identity matrix is always square, having the same number of rows and columns
- **Multiplicative Identity**: When multiplied with any compatible matrix A, the result is A itself
    AI = IA = A
- **Diagonal Matrix**: All elements outside the main diagonal are zero
- **Symmetric**: The transpose of an identity matrix is itself $(I^T = I)$
- **Determinant**: The [[Determinant|determinant]] of any identity matrix is 1
- **Inverse**: The inverse of an identity matrix is itself $(I^{-1} = I)$
