## Definition

- A set of vectors that satisfies two key properties:
    - [[Linear independence]]
    - [[Span|Spanning]]: The set of vectors spans the entire vector space
- A basis is the smallest set of vectors needed to generate the entire vector space through linear combinations

## Characteristics

- A basis is a finite set of vectors
- The number of vectors in a basis determines the dimension of the vector space
- A vector space can have multiple bases, but they will all have the same number of vectors
