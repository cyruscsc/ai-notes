## Defintion

$$
\text{degree of freedom}=n-r(A)
$$

> $n$: number of variables
> $r(A)$: rank of the coefficient matrix $A$

- The number of independent variables or parameters that can vary freely without violating the constraints imposed by the equations

## Full rank system

- $r(A)=n$
- Degree of freedom = 0
- All variables are determined uniquely
- [[Complete systems]]

## Underdetermined system

- $r(A)<n$
- Degree of freedom = $n-r(A)$
- Some variables can vary freely
- [[Redundant systems]]

## Overdetermined system

- $r(A)=n$ if all equations are consistent
- Degree of freedom = 0
- More equations than variables

> Note: the concept of degree of freedom does not apply to [[contradictory systems]] because there is no solution space to describe
