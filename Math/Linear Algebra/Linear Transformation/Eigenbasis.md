## Definition

- A special [[basis]] for a vector space that consists entirely of [[Eigenvalue and Eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of a [[linear transformation]] or matrix

## Characteristics

- An eigenbasis is formed by [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]] eigenvectors that [[span]] the entire vector space
- When a matrix has an eigenbasis, it is said to be diagonalizable
- If a matrix has $n$ distinct [[Eigenvalue and Eigenvector|eigenvalues]] (where $n$ is the dimension of the vector space), it must have an eigenbasis

## Significance

- **Diagonalization**: when expressed in its eigenbasis, the matrix takes on a diagonal form, with eigenvalues along the main diagonal.
- **Simplified Computations**: many matrix operations become significantly easier when working with a diagonalized matrix, including matrix powers and exponentials.
- **Geometric Interpretation**: each eigenvector in the eigenbasis represents a direction in which the linear transformation acts by simple scaling
