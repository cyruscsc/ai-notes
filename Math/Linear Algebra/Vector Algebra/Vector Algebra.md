## Characteristics

- Can be represented geometrically as a directed line segment or arrow

## Operations

- [[Vector Addition]]
- [[Vector Subtraction]]
- [[Scalar Multiplication]]
- [[Dot Product]]

## Magnitude

- The length of the arrow
- [[Manhattan Norm|L1 Norm]]
- [[Euclidean Norm|L2 Norm]]

## Direction

$$
\theta=\arctan(\frac{y}{x})=\tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})
$$

- The orientation of the arrow in space
