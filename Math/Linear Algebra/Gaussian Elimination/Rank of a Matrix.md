## Definition

- The maximum number of linearly independent rows
- Equals the number of non-zero rows in [[row echelon form]]

## Characteristics

- If rank equals the number of variables, there is a unique solution
	- [[Non-singular systems]]
- If rank is less than the number of variables, there are infinitely many solutions
	- [[Singular systems]]
