## Approach

- Start with a random choice of weights
- Repeat:
	- Calculate the gradient descent based on **one data point**: direction that will lead to decreasing loss
	- Update weights according to the gradient

## Characteristics

- The gradient is calculated based on one point chosen at random
- This kind of gradient can be quite inaccurate
