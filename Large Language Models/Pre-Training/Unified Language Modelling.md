## Definition

- Integrates aspects of both [[Full Language Modelling|CLM]] and [[Masked Language Modelling|MLM]]

- Aims to combine the strengths of different modelling approaches
- The model can handle both unidirectional and bidirectional [[attention]] patterns
- Allows for more flexible [[pre-training]] and can potentially lead to models that perform well across a wider range of tasks
