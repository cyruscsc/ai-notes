## Definition

- Enhances the capabilities of [[large language models]] by incorporating external information retrieval
- Allows AI models to access and utilize up-to-date or domain-specific information beyond their original training data, resulting in more accurate and contextually relevant responses

## Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy**: Enables [[Large Language Models|LLMs]] to provide more accurate and up-to-date information by accessing external sources
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Helps minimize AI hallucinations and factual errors by grounding responses in retrieved information
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Reduces the need for frequent model retraining, lowering computational and financial costs
- **Transparency**: Allows for the inclusion of source references, enabling users to verify information
- **Adaptability**: New information can be easily added to the external knowledge base without retraining the entire model
