## Definition

- Breaks down hierarchical or multifaceted queries by retrieving information in stages, starting broad and then narrowing down

## Characterisitics

- Recursively refines search queries based on the results obtained from previous searches
- Improves the depth and relevance of search results
- Enhances the search experience by gradually converging on the most pertinent information through a feedback loop
- Improves accuracy by leveraging document structure and relationships between data chunks
- E.g., IRCoT, ToC

## Process

1. Retrieve high-level summaries or broader context first
2. Drill down into specific chunks or related details based on the initial results
3. Use relationships between document chunks to ensure all relevant information is captured
