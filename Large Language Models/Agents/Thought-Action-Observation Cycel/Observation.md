## Definition

- How an agent perceives the consequences of its actions, which are signals from the environment (e.g., data from an API, error messages, or system logs)

## Process

- **Collect feedback:** Receive data or confirmation that action was successful (or not)
- **Appends results:** Integrate the new information into existing context, effectively updating memory
- **Adapt strategy:** Use this updated context to refine subsequent thoughts and actions

## Types of observations

- **System feedback**: Error messages, success notifications, status codes
- **Data changes**: Database updates, file system modifications, state changes
- **Environmental data**: Sensor readings, system metrics, resource usage
- **Response analysis**: API responses, query results, computation outputs
- **Time-based events**: Deadlines reached, scheduled tasks completed

## Appending results

1. **Parse the action** to identify the function(s) to call and the argument(s) to use
2. **Execute the action**
3. **Append the result** as an **Observation**
