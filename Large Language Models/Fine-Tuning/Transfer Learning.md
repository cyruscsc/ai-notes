# Definition

- A technique that leverages knowledge from a [[Pre-Training|pre-trained]] model to improve performance on a new, related task

## Characteristics

- adapts a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or domain without major changes to the model's parameters
- Fine-tunes the pre-trained model on a smaller, task-specific dataset
- Aims to balance retaining general knowledge from [[pre-training]] while adapting to the new task
