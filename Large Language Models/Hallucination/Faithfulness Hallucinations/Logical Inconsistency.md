## Defintion

- The generated outputs exhibit internal logical contradictions, often observed in reasoning tasks
- Manifests as inconsistency both among the reasoning steps themselves and between the steps and the final answer

## Example

> Instruction:
> ```
> Solve the equation 2x + 3 = 11 step by step.
> ```
> Response:
> ```
> Step 1: Subtract 3 from both sides to get: 2x = 8. 
> Step 2: Divide both sides by 2 to get: x = 3. 
> So the result of the equation is x=3.
> ```
